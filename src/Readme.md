# AutoDrink

AutoDrink provides a personal marco to help prioritize food consumption.

It will attempt to use non-buff (purchased, cheaper to make) foods if you have a "Well Fed" buff, and buff foods if you do not have "Well Fed".
Food and drink will not be consumed again while you are currently eating or drinking.
Define the lists in the macro.

## How to use

AutoDrink will create a default macro in the personalized macros, if there is space.
The default macro is:

```#showtooltip
/AutoDrink Conjured Mana Fritter, Conjured Mana Pudding, Ley-Enriched Water, Highmountain Spring Water
/AutoBuff
/click AutoDrink
```

Personalize the macro by changing the list of foods for each slash command.
Put non-buff food and drink in the list passed to /AutoDrink.
Put buff giving food and drink to /AutoBuff.

Clicking the AutoDrink button will activate the macro for that button.
